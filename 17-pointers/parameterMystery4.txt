The following code produces 4 lines of output. What is the output? Write each line of output as it would appear on the console.

For the purposes of this problem, assume that the variables in main are stored at the following memory addresses:

main's a variable is stored at address 0xaa00
main's b variable is stored at address 0xbb00
main's c variable is stored at address 0xcc00
main's d variable is stored at address 0xdd00

int parameterMystery4(int& a, int* b, int c) {
    a--;
    c = c * 2;
    cout << c << " " << a << " " << *b << endl;
    (*b)++;
    return a + c;
}
​
int main() {
    int a = 2;
    int b = 5;
    int c = -3;
    int d;
​
    parameterMystery4(a, &b, c);
    d = parameterMystery4(c, &a, b);
    parameterMystery4(b, &d, a);
​
    cout << a << " " << b << " " << c << " " << d << endl;
​
    return 0;
}
