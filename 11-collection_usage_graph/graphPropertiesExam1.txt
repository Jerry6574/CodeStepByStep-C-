Answer: 

Write the order that a depth-first search (DFS) would visit vertexes if it were looking for a path from vertex A to vertex I. Assume that any "for-each" loop over neighbors returns them in ABC order. Write the vertex names in order, separated by commas.	
Answer: 

Write the path that such a DFS would return.	
Answer: 

Write the order that a breadth-first search (BFS) would visit vertexes if it were looking for a path from vertex C to vertex H. Assume that any "for-each" loop over neighbors returns them in ABC order. Write the vertex names in order, separated by commas.	
Answer: 

Write the path that such a BFS would return.
